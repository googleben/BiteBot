# BiteBot
A (somewhat) simple bot mainly to play audio commands over discord like a soundboard.

I made this as mostly a form of prodding on the creator of another bot to add some more features, so it's likely it
won't be updated often if at all. It was made in the space of a few hours so don't expect anything much in the way of 
code quality.

# Usage
Put your bot token alone in a file called token.txt in the main directory, build with maven, and everything should work.
